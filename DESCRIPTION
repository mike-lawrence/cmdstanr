Description: A lightweight interface to 'Stan' <https://mc-stan.org>.
    The 'CmdStanR' interface is an alternative to 'RStan' that calls the command 
    line interface for compilation and running algorithms instead of interfacing 
    with C++ via 'Rcpp'. Methods are provided for conveniently reading the 
    results into R.
